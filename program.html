            <p>Now let’s learn about how respiratory infections, like COVID-19, are transmitted and what actions you can take to prevent the spread of infections.</p>
            <p>A virus is a tiny infectious agent that is too small to be seen with the human eye or even under a normal microscope. They can only replicate and multiply if inside a living organism such as a human, animal, or plant which acts as the host.</p>
			<p>Respiratory viruses like to infect the lungs and airways. Respiratory infections tend to affect the normal function of the lungs causing breathing problems.</p>

            <h2 class="mb-4">What is COVID-19?</h2>
            <p>COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.</p>
            <p>Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV).</p>
			<p>The new coronavirus is spread from one person to another primarily through respiratory droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes. According to recent reports, it may be possible that people infected with the novel coronavirus spread the virus before showing significant symptoms.</p>
		 <p>Some patients with confirmed infections with the novel coronavirus have showed little to no symptoms while others have become severely ill and died. Symptoms of infection include: Fever, cough and shortness of breath. At this time, it is believed that symptoms may appear in as few as 2 days or as long as 14 days after exposure.</p>
		 <p>Scientists are working hard to understand this new virus and produce a vaccine. Antibiotics do not work against viruses; they only work on bacterial infections. Therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention.</p>

	            <h2 class="mb-4">How are Respiratory Infections Transmitted?</h2>
	            <p class="mb-4">There are three main modes of transmission.</p>

							<div class="text ml-5">
								<h3>Droplet Transmission</h3>
								<p>Droplet transmission happens when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks, and tiny drops from the infected person enter another person's eyes, nose, mouth.</p>
								<p>The COVID-19 virus is transmitted through droplet transmission.</p>
							</div>

							<div class="icon d-flex justify-content-center align-items-center">
								<span class="icon-arrow-right"></span>
							</div>
							<div class="text ml-5">
								<h3>Contact Transmission</h3>
								<p>Contact transmission occurs when there is a physical contact between an infected person/contaminated object and other person.this can happen in one of two ways:</p>
								<p>Through direct contact where the infection travels to another person through touch.</p>
								<p>Through indirect contact when a person touches an object contaminated by COVID-19.</p>
								<p>The COVID-19 virus can be transmitted through contact. When an infected person coughs, droplets can land on objects and surfaces around them. When another person touches these surfaces, their hands can get contaminated with virus. If they touch their nose or mouth with contaminated hands, they can get infected.</p>

							<div class="icon d-flex justify-content-center align-items-center">
								<span class="icon-arrow-right"></span>
							</div>
							<div class="text ml-5">
								<h3>Airborne Transmission</h3>
								<p>Airborne transmission of virus occurs when small particles in the air (less than 5 μm in size) containing the virus are inhaled into a person's respiratory system. These infected particles can live in the air for a long period of time, leading to spread of infection.</p>
								<p>Although one study reported that the virus can remain viable in the air for up to three hours, more research is needed to confirm if airborne transmission occurs</p>

				<p>There are six steps in the chain of infection and we know that transmission will only take place if all six elements in the chain are present.</p>

            <h2 class="mb-4">The Six Elements in the Chain of Infection</h2>
            <p>In order for an infection or disease to happen, six elements must be in place. This process is known as the chain of infection. The first element in the chain is an infectious agent, which can cause a disease. It could be a virus, bacteria, or fungi.</p>
            <p>The second element is the reservoir, or the place where the infectious agent lives. It can be a person, an animal, soil or water. Then we have a port of exit, which is the way the agent leaves the body. This can happen through the mouth, if a person coughs or sneezes, through a cut, if a person is bleeding, during diaper changes or toileting.</p>
			<p>The next element is the mode of transmission, which is how the infectious agent is transmitted from one person to another. It can be in form of droplets, direct or indirect contact, or through airborne transmission.</p>
         <p>The fifth element in the chain of infection is the port of entry, or the place where the infectious agent enters another person’s body. This is similar to the port of exit, it can be a mouth, nose, eyes, an open cut etc.</p>
         <p>Finally, we have a susceptible host – it’s either a baby, an elderly person or someone with a weakened immune system. To prevent the spread of the disease, one of the links in the chain of infection must be broken.</p>

        	<p>Yes! Washing your hands is one of the best ways to prevent you or someone you know from getting infected.</p>
			<p>Washing your hands frequently helps to remove potentially harmful microorganisms from your hands. And this helps stop the spread of infection.</p>
			<p>The WHO (World Health Organization) recommends washing your hands by following the 7 steps shown in the image and video below.</p>

            <p>These simple steps can help to reduce the spread of COVID-19</p>
            <p>1) Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and dispose of the tissue immediately.</p>
			<p>2) If you do not have atissue, sneeze into your elbow rather than your hands.</p>

            <p>Now think, how many times have you cleaned those surfaces?</p>
            <p>To break the chain and prevent infection, it is important to be more mindful about the surfaces we touch and to keep those surfaces clean.</p>
			<p>There are a number of ways to keep your surfaces clean and disinfected. And you probably already have some of these ways in the house!</p>
			<p>Do you have bleach in the house?  Follow simple bleach cleaning recipe:</p>
			<p>1) Mix 3/4 cup Regular Bleach with one gallon of water.</p>
			<p>2) Using a rag or spray bottle, wash or wipe this solution onto surfaces.</p>
         <p>3) Allow solution to stand for atleast 5 minutes.</p>
         <p>4) Rinse with regular water and let air dry.</p>
         <p>You can also use a regular household disinfectant or using an alcohol spray of at least 60% alcohol. Both can be purchased at any grocery store.</p>
         <p>And don’t forget to clean your cell phone!</p>

            <p>Social distancing is a public health measure known to help stop or slow the spread of infectious diseases. This is especially important with COVID-19 because even those who do not show signs of illness may be sick and can spread the virus.</p>
            <p>Ways to social distance include:</p>
			<p>1) Closing schools and moving to distance learning.</p>
			<p>2) Working from home.</p>
			 <p>3) Postponing or cancelling social events and travel.</p>
			 <p>4) Maintaining a physical distance of at least 2 metres between other people.</p>

            <h2 class="mb-4">Do I need to wear a face mask?</h2>
            <p>No doubt you have seen pictures or even people walking around wearing surgical or protective N95 masks.</p>
            <p>While this might seem like a good idea, wearing a mask in many cases does more harm than good to you and your community.</p>
			<p>Healthcare workers are the only people who can help us get better when we are sick. Because of the current shortage of face masks in the world, healthcare workers are at increased risk of contracting COVID-19. If healthcare workers get sick, there will be no one to take care of the sick people, and COVID-19 may continue to spread.</p>
			<p>So…do you need to wear a mask?   The answer to this question for most people is No.</p>
         <p>You can help to be part of the solution by urging others not to buy masks or protective gloves for their own use. These are a limited resource, desperately needed by our healthcare workers and the sick.</p>
         <p>You should only wear a mask if:</p>
         <p>1) You are a healthcare provider caring for potentially sick patients.</p>
         <p>2) You are sick or are caring for a family member who is sick.</p>
         <p>3) You are instructed to do so by your doctor or healthcare provider.</p>
         <p>You are instructed to do so by your local government authorities.</p>
